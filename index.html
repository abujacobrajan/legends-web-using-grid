            <p class="about">Steve Jobs was one of the founders of Apple Inc., one of the most successful companies in
                the world. As head of Apple, Jobs introduced many popular electronic products, including the Macintosh
                computer and the iPhone.Steven Paul Jobs was born on February 24, 1955, in San Francisco, California,
                U.S. He was adopted and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area. He had a younger sister, Patricia.In 1972
                Jobs went to college for less than a year. In 1974 he worked at Atari, a video-game company. Later that
                year he began working with an old friend named Stephen Wozniak.</p>

                tell a computer what to do. The success of Microsoft made Gates one of the richest people in the
                world.t Lakeside, Bill became an excellent student. He also discovered computers. When he was 13, he
                wrote his first software program: a tic-tac-toe game.

            <p class="about">At age 10 Torvalds began to dabble in computer programming on his grandfather’s Commodore
                VIC-20. In 1991, while a computer science student at the University of Helsinki (M.S., 1996), he
                purchased his first personal computer (PC). He was not satisfied, however, with the computer’s operating
                system (OS). His PC used MS-DOS (the disk operating system from Microsoft Corp.), but Torvalds preferred
                the UNIX operating system he had used on the university’s computers. He decided to create his own
                PC-based version of UNIX. Months of determined programming work yielded the beginnings of an operating
                system known as Linux. In 1991 he posted a message on the Internet to alert other PC users to his new
                system, made the software available for free downloading, and, as was a common practice among software
                developers at the time, he released the source code, which meant that anyone with knowledge of computer
                programming could modify Linux to suit their own purposes. Because of their access to the source code,
                many programmers helped Torvalds retool and refine the software, and by 1994 Linux kernel (original
                code) version 1.0 was released.</p>

            <p class="about">Alan Turing was a British mathematician. He made major contributions to the fields of
                mathematics, computer science, and artificial intelligence. He worked for the British government during
                World War II, when he succeeded in breaking the secret code Germany used to communicate.

                In 2019 the Bank of England announced that Turing would be featured on the new 50-pound banknote. The
                note was expected to enter circulation in 2021.Alan Mathison Turing was born on June 23, 1912, in
                London, England. He was educated at a top private school and then attended the University of Cambridge.
                He wrote a number of important papers while there. In 1936 Turing moved to Princeton University in the
                United States to study for a doctorate in mathematical logic. It was during that time that he introduced
                the theory for a computing device called the Turing machine. The Turing machine became the basis for all
                digital computers. Turing completed the doctorate in 1938.In September 1939 Great Britain went to war
                against Germany. During the war, Turing worked at the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley
                Park. Turing and others designed a code-breaking machine known as the Bombe. They used the Bombe to
                learn German military secrets. By early 1942 the code breakers at Bletchley Park were decoding about
                39,000 messages a month. At the end of the war, Turing was made an Officer of the Most Excellent Order
                of the British Empire.</p>
